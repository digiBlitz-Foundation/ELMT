  <p><strong>eBlitz BPEL Engine </strong>executes business processes written following the <a href="http://ode.apache.org/ws-bpel-20.html" title="WS-BPEL 2.0">WS-BPEL</a> standard. It talks to web services, sending and receiving messages as described by the process definition.</p>
  <p><strong>WS-BPEL</strong> is an XML-based language defining several constructs to write  business processes. It defines a set of basic control structures like  conditions or loops as well as elements to invoke web services and  receive messages from services. It relies on WSDL to express web  services interfaces. Message structures can be manipulated, assigning  parts or the whole of them to variables that can in turn be used to  send other messages.</p>
