              <p>I have applied to participate in this HLC sponsored educational 
                activity. I agree that my participation is subject to theconditions 
                in this release and to those set by the organizer of this activity, 
                the regulations and requirements of the HLC, and,where applicable,<strong> the U.S. Equestrian Federation Rules for Eventing.<br />
                                      </strong><br />
                                      <strong>I agree</strong> to wear protective headgear when riding. 
                When jumping, I agree to wear protective headgear passing orsurpassing 
                the ASTM/SEI standards with harness attached that meets standards 
                currently imposed by the<strong> U.S. Equestrian Rulesfor Eventing</strong>. 
                I understand that the HLC mandates that all riders participating 
                in cross-country activity wear body protectingvests that meet 
                or exceed current USEF rules and the wearing of an approved 
                medical armband.<br />
                                      <br />
                                      <strong>I understand</strong> that the sport of eventing is 
                a high risk sport, and that my participation in this educational 
                activity mayalso involve participation in an &quot;equine activity&quot; 
                as defined by applicable laws and is wholly at my own risk. 
                I understand that myparticipation involves all inherent risks 
                associated with the dangers and conditions which are an integral 
                part of equine activities,including, but not limited to, the 
                propensity of equines to behave in ways which may result in 
                injury, harm or even death tohumans or other animals around 
                or near them; the unpredictability of equine reaction to sounds, 
                sudden movements, smells, andunfamiliar objects; persons or 
                other animals; hazards related to surface and subsurface conditions; 
                collisions with other equines orobjects; and, the potential 
                of a participant to act in a negligent or unskilled manner which 
                may contribute to injury to theparticipant or others, including 
                failing or inability to maintain control over the animal. By 
                participating in this activity I agree to<br />
                assume responsibility for those risks, and I release and agree 
                to hold harmless the activity organizer, organizing committee,officials, 
                the HLC, USEF, their officers, agents, employees and the volunteers 
                assisting in the conduct of this HLC educationalactivity and 
                the owners of any property on which it is to be held, from all 
                liability for negligence resulting in accidents, damage,injury 
                or illness to myself and to my property, including the horse(s) 
                which I may ride.<br />
                                      <br />
                                      <strong>I understand and agree</strong> that the organizer
